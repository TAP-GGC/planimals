## Accessing the Workshop File Through CS First

<!--- INSERT YOUR OWN .sb3 FILE IN THE PARENTHESIS!! THIS IS 1/3 LINKS YOU MUST REPLACE--->
### Step 1. Download the [.sb3](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Code/Complete%20Code%20for%20the%20Game.sb3) file

The file can be found in the code folder of this repository or accessed directly through the highlighted text above. 

Click on 'view raw' to download (make sure to download a copy to a flash drive if your Classroom doesn’t have access to Google Drive/OneDrive!)

* Click 'Load from your computer' and select the sb3 file that was downloaded earlier. We recommend saving it to the downloads folder so it can be accessed more easily.

## Sharing the Workshop with Your Classroom

<p align="center">
At the time of this document's creation, there is unfortunately no way to share custom .sb3 files or CS First Playground Projects to a Google Classroom through CS First. 
</p>
<p align="center">
Here are a few alternative methods suggested by the CS First Customer Support Team for sharing the workshop with your class.
</p>

### Option 1: Sharing the file via Google Drive

If you have a Google Drive/OneDrive account that is accessible to your classroom, you can take the downloaded [.sb3](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Code/Complete%20Code%20for%20the%20Game.sb3) file and upload it somewhere that your students can easily access it. 

<!--- CONTRIBUTORS: REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS LINK!! 2/3--->

Once they’ve downloaded the file, they can follow the same steps taken in Step 2 of the [Accessing the Workshop File](#step-2-uploading-to-cs-first) segment of this document.
