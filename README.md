# Planimals:  A game that emphasizes the importance of programming statements

## About

We are part of the TAP program at GGC, and our objective is to teach programming skills through building a fun game. The platform we’re choosing to design this game on is SCRATCH. The name of our game is Planimals because it focuses on the life cycles of plants and animals. 

The game has a grow and regress feature; if a plant/animal were to touch an undesired object, they would regress, and if it were to encounter their desired item, it would grow. Ideally, the animals/plants are developing through different stages of life. For instance, a bird would start in an egg, hatch into a baby bird, then develop into an adult bird. 

One of the main elements that make this game challenging is that the path to winning is not a straight line. Everyone will have an individual experience depending on their skill set and how fast they catch onto the game. While it might take one person a couple of minutes to win, it may take somebody else longer. This adds a resonance of frustration and eagerness to develop your skills, change your approach and ultimately win the game. 

We hope that you get the chance to experience and enjoy our game at the STARS event!

## Description

* Difficulty Level: Easy
* Target Audience: 6th grade - College
* Duration of Workshop: 1 hour 
* Needed Materials: Computers with keyboards, Access to Scratch.com OR CS First Scratch.
* Learning outcomes: The two primary goals of this project is teaching the students the basics of Scratch and giving them a crash course on algorithms.
* Scratch is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab as an educational tool for children. Through our classroom workshops and outreach activities, students get to learn how to program character movement and sprite animation in Scratch, using the fundamental programming concepts such as variables, if-else statements, and loops. These experiences will help them develop problem-solving and logical reasoning skills that can be applied to other programming languages as well as other fields outside of computing. Through this project, we hope to increase interest and participation in STEM; and show that learning how to program can be fun and creative.
* [TAP](https://ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program) (Technology Ambassadors Program) is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## Outreach

1. TAP Expo, April 1, 2021, Georgia Gwinnett College: to promote the IT field and encourage college students to sign up for TAP.
2. Class Workshops, April 13-15, 2021, Georgia Gwinnett College: to promote the IT field to non-IT students.

## Technology

The technology used for this project was an online coding program called Scratch. Scratch uses block coding, which means programs are made with premade chunks of code. This makes it easier for people new to programming because there is little typing of code involved.
